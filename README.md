# Golang Bootcamp

Hi! I'm your first Markdown file in **StackEdit**. If you want to learn about StackEdit, you can read me. If you want to play with Markdown, you can edit me. Once you have finished with me, you can create new files by opening the **file explorer** on the left corner of the navigation bar.

## Run

Clone the repository and execute the following command on the root folder

``` bash
go run main.go
```

## Selected architecture
Since the applications made in Go should be applications that are characterized by the speed and simplicity in their code in addition to the low level of depth, I found that La Clean architecture fits the way of working with Go very well with its separation of each layer. and part of the project working together using the interfaces and ports in such a way that one does not depend on the other specifically but that each part can change and be compatible with the other parts of the architecture.

## Files
 - dataFile.csv  Sample file to be displayed  in console by Go.
